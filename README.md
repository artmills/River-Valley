# Procedural-River-Valley-Generator

Procedurally generates river valleys. 
Mountains and valleys are generated using Perlin noise.
Water tiles are procedurally placed in regions of low elevation, resulting in rivers.
These water tiles utilize advanced water effects implemented with shaders: reflection, diffraction, waves, Fresnel effects.
Smooth lighting and shadows from a single light source are implemented as well.

This was my submission for the Final Project for OSU's CS 557 in Winter 2020.
Is currently inactive, but I'm sure I'll revive this at some point in a different form. Being able to create this kind of project is why I wanted to pursue computer graphics and geometry.


Current features:
* Procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise, including procedural water tiles.
* Per-fragment lighting from one light source.
* Shadow mapping from one light source.
* Reflective and refractive water effects on water tiles.
