Final Project for OSU's CS 557: Procedural terrain, shadows, water effects.

Old project from taking OSU's CS 550/557 in Fall 2019 and Winter 2020. 
Is currently inactive, but I'm sure I'll revive this at some point in a different form. Being able to create this kind of project is why I wanted to pursue computer graphics and geometry.

Current features:
* Procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise, including procedural water tiles.
* Per-fragment lighting from one light source.
* Shadow mapping from one light source.
* Reflective and refractive water effects on water tiles.
